  "description": "BuzzPoint is an app that communicates a cityâ€™s growth by capturing a user rating of an area / object / place and posting that to a city zone/boro. This form of communication will yield a more vivid picture of HOW a city is growing in real time. It will also be a helpful daily update for public transit choices, new art installations, restaurants, parks etc. The client will be fun and subjective user experience for the user and the governing metro body ( or to whom it may concern ) will be able to derive insights based on aggregate feedback ( proper data coupling ) from the population that will make solutions clearer as the city looks to expand and optimize its growth.",
